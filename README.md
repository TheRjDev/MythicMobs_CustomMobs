# MythicMobs_CustomMobs
Custom Mobs, skills and items from my personal minecraft server.
Most mobs are designed to be beatable with vanilla equipmente between 1 and 4 players.

List of Mobs:
<ul>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://github.com/TheRjDev/MythicMobs_CustomMobs/blob/main/Mobs/DarkElf.yml">Dark Elf</a> 
        <p> 
            A miniboss that can blind their targets for a short ammount of time and teleport
            to attack them if they try to escape, I recommend it to be used alone as a first 
            miniboss or with other mob as a support. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://github.com/TheRjDev/MythicMobs_CustomMobs/blob/main/Mobs/UndeadDoll.yml">Undead Doll</a>
            <p> 
                A miniboss that can summon a clone of itself to attack the player, it can also
                summon a clone of itself to distract the player while it teleports to attack them.
            </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/TheRjDev/MythicMobs_CustomMobs/blob/main/Mobs/Surtur.yml">Surtur</a>
            <p> 
                A Boss with a considerable damage, it has some fast long range attacks and is inmune to 
                projectiles when it has less of 20% of its health, it also can summon some minor minions
                known as Draugr and can heal with fire when its health is less than 50%.
                It's designed to fight on the nether and it can be a very good first boss for a server.
                Finally, It's very hard to kill it solo, so I recommend to fight it with 2 or 3 players.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <a href="https://github.com/TheRjDev/MythicMobs_CustomMobs/blob/main/Mobs/Draugr.yml">Draugr</a>
                    <p> 
                        A minion that can be summoned by Surtur, it's very slow but has a considerable damage and
                        can be enough tanky to be a good distraction for the players.
                    </p>

            </ul>
